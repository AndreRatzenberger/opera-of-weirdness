# 🛸 The Fleet of the Opera of Weirdness

While the Opera may be best known for its legendary performances and chaotic musical archives, much of its strangest and most glorious work happens **out there** — in the swirling, wobbling, reality-flexing wilds of the cosmos.

The **Opera Fleet** is tasked with locating, acquiring, and not being vaporized by the rarest sounds and sonic curiosities in the multiverse.

Each ship is unique. Each crew is deeply qualified, questionably sane, and rhythmically trained.  
Together, they form the loudest, most dysfunctional, and most accomplished field division in known space.

## 👩‍🚀 Fleet Personnel Notes

Opera ships are often crewed by:

- **Dimensional Sound Hunters**
- **Grooviton Surgeons**
- **Temporal Cartographers**
- **Sentient AI Archivists**
- And occasionally a confused intern or pastry

All crew are rhythm-screened, tactically harmonized, and contractually forbidden from whistling in warp corridors.

## 🎭 Fleet Operations Division

Supervised (or lightly tolerated) by the **Opera's Department of Extracosmic Retrieval and Mobile Grooviton Logistics**, the fleet operates autonomously across space, time, and theme.

> *"If you hear it, follow it. If it hums, record it.  
If it starts dancing, ask for backup."*

— Standard Fleet Protocol, Paragraph 3
