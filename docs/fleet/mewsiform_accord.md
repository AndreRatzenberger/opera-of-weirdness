# 🛸 The Mewsiform Accord

> *“Built for speed. Tuned for groove. Cat-approved.”*

The **Mewsiform Accord** is the personal research vessel of **Senior Dimensional Sound Hunter Lucy the Cat** and currently the flagship of the Opera’s Field Research Division.

Designed to explore high-weirdness zones and respond to irregular groove spikes in space-time, the Mewsiform Accord is renowned for both its adaptability and its uncanny ability to *accidentally* drift into pocket dimensions where the music is just a little too funky.
