## 📖 Cultural Notes

Over subsequent 47,652 years after voc-17993 got discoverd in the bakery, this peculiar pastry — now classified as **Entity 7-B: *Confused Confection of Velbora*** — became a beloved novelty among the locals.  
(The emitted phrase, incidentally, bears an uncanny resemblance to a vital component of the Velboran mating call.)

Following several incidents of diplomatic confusion, three minor wars, and a short-lived musical movement, the sentient pastry was graciously **donated** to the Opera of Weirdness, where it now resides in the **Hall of Phonetic Anomalies**.
