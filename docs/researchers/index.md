# Researchers of the Opera of Weirdness

The cosmic absurdities that echo through the halls of the Opera of Weirdness do not simply find themselves.
They are sought, discovered, documented, and occasionally wrestled into submission by the Opera’s fearless team of researchers.

Armed with curiosity, questionable judgment, and a wide array of highly experimental equipment (half of which may or may not violate the fundamental laws of physics), our researchers traverse the universe to capture the melodies no one else dares to hear.

From cataloging the bioluminescent arias of underwater dreamers to recording the reluctant sighs of dimensional rifts, the Research Division ensures that every sound, no matter how improbable or distressingly musical, finds its rightful place within the Opera's vast archives.
