## 🧠 What is a Grooviton?

A **Grooviton** is a hypothetical — and yet strangely very real — subatomic particle responsible for transmitting rhythm across the fabric of space-time.  
Discovered entirely by accident (and one remarkably funky telescope technician), Groovitons are the **quantum bridge between music and gravity**.

They are released naturally whenever:

- Basslines drop near stellar bodies
- Dance moves are performed in strong gravitational fields
- Someone claps in 7/8 time on a neutron star

## ⚙️ Physical Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Particle Family | Rhythm Boson |
| Spin | Funky (non-integer) |
| Mass | Depends entirely on vibe |
| Charge | Electrically neutral, but emotionally charged |
| Speed | Travels at the *speed of head-nod* |

Groovitons are not directly observable, but their presence is implied by spontaneous toe-tapping in low-gravity environments.

## 📏 The Groovitonic Scale

Groovitons are also used as a **scientific unit of groove**, used by musicians, physicists, and cool cats across the known multiverse.

| Groovitons (gvt) | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| 0 gvt | Utterly groove-dead. Like a PDF of silence. |
| 0.5 gvt | Elevator hold music, pre-jazz. |
| 1 gvt | Acceptable toe-tap range. Tap cautiously. |
| 2 gvt | Funk adjacent. Synchronized shoulder swaying observed. |
| 5 gvt | Dangers of involuntary head bobbing. |
| 10 gvt | Immediate dancefloor material. Shipwide groove emergency may be declared. |
| 20+ gvt | Illegal in 7 systems. May distort time signatures in local reality. |

Grooviton detectors must be recalibrated during Mercury retrograde and disco eclipses.

## 🧃 Where Are They Found?

Groovitons are commonly found near:

- Black holes that once hosted funk concerts
- Collapsing stars that collapsed in style
- Forgotten jukeboxes orbiting rogue moons
- The **Gravirhythm Wells of Singulon**, where Groovitons practically leak from the space-time fabric

Groovitons have also been unintentionally summoned during saxophone solos of sufficient emotional intensity.

## 🔬 Research Status

Officially categorized as:
- **“Empirically unprovable, but extremely danceable”**

Groovitons remain a key area of research within the **Department of Quantum Vibes and Experimental Rhythmology.**
