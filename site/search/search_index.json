After a long career of dabbling in quantum entanglement and making exceedingly good cakes, Zebulon decided to merge his two greatest passions: the incomprehensible nature of the universe and opera.</p> <p>Rumors suggest that Zebulon was inspired by a dream in which he attended a performance by a choir of singing quarks accompanied by a neutron on the saxophone.

The construction materials included dreamstone (which only exists when you aren't looking at it), paradoxium (a substance that defies explanation and gravity), and a generous helping of whimsy.</p> <p>The resulting structure is a dizzying array of spiraling spires, floating platforms, and non-Euclidean corridors that twist and turn in ways that would make M.C. Escher ask for a seatbelt. The main auditorium is capable of seating an audience of thirty-seven billion (or just two, depending on how it feels that day) and boasts acoustics that can make even the sound of a pin dropping sound like an orchestral masterpiece.</p>"},{"location":"about/#the-performances-and-curiosities","title":"The Performances and Curiosities","text":"<p>The Opera of Weirdness hosts performances that defy all conventional understanding of music.
